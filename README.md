# Cybernetics Done Right: The Big Picture

> The idea behind the **Cybernetics** curriculum is great: an **interdisciplinary** approach to solving complex economic problems. Unfortunately, the execution lacks behind and is not in line with the grand vision or recent developments. This repository will walk through 5 years with an **alternative curricula**, code and learning paths, which is:

* Theoretically rigorous and sound, leverages mathematical, statistical and domain understanding. Some elements of abstract math to understand the underlying foundations.
* Applications are based on actual code and implementations, on real data. Introduces real world challenges related to deploying models and improving decision making in organizations.
* Simulations are used extensively to get a feel of the behavior of models and algorithms.
* No bullshit subjects just to fill in the credits


# Computer Science

A focus shifted from software development to scientific computing, emphasizing the challenges in deploying models, BI, data modeling, big data, streaming, containers and automation. Usage of high-level languages as Python and R, containters, APIs above low-level concerns of pointers, memory allocation and parallel computing.





# Mathematics

A rigorous preparation and mathematical background.


# Statistics and Econometrics

A path towards Computer Age Statistical Inference.




# Machine Learning and Deep Learning

A path to the cutting-edge methods and models for machine learning.
